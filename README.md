# HelloWorldProject
Hello World Project has one current business requirement to write “Hello World” to the console/screen.  The program have an API that is separated from the program logic to eventually support mobile applications, web applications, or console applications, or windows services.  The program supports future enhancements for writing to a database, console application, etc.  Used common design patterns (inheritance, e.g.) to account for these future concerns.  Used configuration files or another industry-standard mechanism for determining where to write the information to. Unit tests to support the API.
